## Introduction
Recent advances in generative modeling through deep learning approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and sequence-to-sequence models will enable new kinds of user experiences around content creation, giving us “creative superpowers” and move us toward co-creation and curation. While the areas of computational design, generative design, and computational art have existed for some time, content with unprecedented fidelity is now being produced due to breakthroughs in generative modeling using deep learning. Ian Goodfellow’s work on face generation and StyleGan, OpenAI’s GPT-2, or recent deep fake videos of Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are prominent examples of content generated by AI that is almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. These examples also highlight some of the significant societal, ethical and organizational challenges generative AI is posing including security, privacy, ownership, quality metrics and evaluation of generated content.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both fields HCI and AI to explore and better
understand both the opportunities and challenges of generative modelling from an HCI perspective. We envision that the user experience of creating both physical and digital artifacts will become a partnership of humans and AI: Humans will take the role of specification, goal setting, steering, high-level creativity, curation, and governance. AI will augment human abilities through inspiration, low level creativity and detail work, and the ability to test ideas at scale.

Submissions are encouraged but not limited to the following topics:

- Novel user experiences supporting the creation of both physical
and digital artifacts in an AI augmented fashion
- Business use cases of generative models
- Novel applications of generative models
- Techniques, methodologies & algorithms that enable new
user experiences and interactions with generative models
and allow for directed and purposeful manipulation of the
model output
- Governance, privacy, content ownership
- Security including forensic tools and approaches for deep
fake detection
- Evaluation of generative approaches and quality metrics
- User studies
- Lessons learned from computational art and design, and
generative design and how these impact research

## Submission Guidelines

We are encouraging the submissions of full and short papers following the [IUI Paper Guidelines](https://iui.acm.org/2020/call_for_papers.html). 

We also would like to see demos of generative deep learning systems that highlight co-creation user experiences or other topics listed above. The submission of demos also follows [IUI Demo Guidelines](https://iui.acm.org/2020/call_for_demo_poster.html)
