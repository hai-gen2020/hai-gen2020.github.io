#### Abstract ####
Magenta is an open-source project exploring the role of machine learning as a tool in the creative process.We've been running in public (g.co/magenta) for almost four years. This talk will look back at successes and frustrations in bringing our work to creators, mostly musicians. I'll also talk about some current and future work.  Magenta is made up of several ML researchers and engineers on the Google Brain team, which focuses on deep learning. Our successes have mostly been in the area of new algorithm development (NSynth, MusicVAE, Music Transformer, DDSP and others). Our frustrations have been in finding ways to make these models useful for music creators. The talk will be a casual example-driven discussion about what worked and what didn't, and where we're going next. Spoiler: we have been humbled by the user interface challenges encountered when building tools for creative work. However we think we're turned the corner on this, in no small part thanks to more engagements with HCI experts like those who attend IUI.


#### Bio ####
Douglas Eck is a Principal Scientist at Google Research, currently working in the Paris office. He is leading the Magenta Project, a Google Brain effort to create music, video, images and text using deep learning and reinforcement learning. He is also exploring related research in generative models for domains like open-ended dialog and video generation.  Before focusing on generative models for media, Doug worked in areas such as music perception, aspects of music performance, machine learning for large audio datasets and music recommendation. He completed his PhD in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at Indiana University in 2000 and went on to a postdoctoral fellowship with Juergen Schmidhuber at IDSIA in Lugano Switzerland. Before joining Google in 2010, Doug was faculty in Computer Science at the University of Montreal (MILA machine learning lab) where he became Associate Professor.

### Workshop Description
Recent advances in generative modeling through deep learning approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and sequence-to-sequence models will enable new kinds of user experiences around content creation, giving us “creative superpowers” and move us toward co-creation and curation. While the areas of computational design, generative design, and computational art have existed for some time, content with unprecedented fidelity is now being produced due to breakthroughs in generative modeling using deep learning. Ian Goodfellow’s work on face generation and StyleGan, OpenAI’s GPT-2, or recent deep fake videos of Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are prominent examples of content generated by AI that is almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. These examples also highlight some of the significant societal, ethical and organizational challenges generative AI is posing including security, privacy, ownership, quality metrics and evaluation of generated content.

The goal of this half-day workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both fields HCI and AI to explore and better understand both the opportunities and challenges of generative modelling from an HCI perspective. We envision that the user experience of creating both physical and digital artifacts will become a partnership of humans and AI: Humans will take the role of specification, goal setting, steering, high-level creativity, curation, and governance. AI will augment human abilities through inspiration, low level creativity and detail work, and the ability to test ideas at scale.

Submissions are encouraged but not limited to the following topics:

- Novel user experiences supporting the creation of both physical
and digital artifacts in an AI augmented fashion
- Business use cases of generative models
- Novel applications of generative models
- Techniques, methodologies & algorithms that enable new
user experiences and interactions with generative models
and allow for directed and purposeful manipulation of the
model output
- Governance, privacy, content ownership
- Security including forensic tools and approaches for deep
fake detection
- Evaluation of generative approaches and quality metrics
- User studies
- Lessons learned from computational art and design, and
generative design and how these impact research

### Submission Guidelines

We are encouraging submissions of **full and short papers** following the [IUI Paper Guidelines](https://iui.acm.org/2020/call_for_papers.html) as well as **demos** of generative deep learning systems that highlight co-creation user experiences or other topics listed above. The submission of demos also follows [IUI Demo Guidelines](https://iui.acm.org/2020/call_for_demo_poster.html).

All papers will be peer reviewed, single blind (i.e. author names and affiliations should be listed). If accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present the work.

A workshop summary will be included in the ACM Digital Library for IUI 2020. While papers and demos are not part of the archival ACM IUI proceedings, we will be published them online at [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/).

Please submit your papers & demos to EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=haigen2020#](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=haigen2020#)
