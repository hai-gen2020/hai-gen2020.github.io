Recent advances in generative modeling will enable new kinds of user experiences around content creation, giving us "creative superpowers" and move us toward co-creation. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from both fields HCI and AI to explore and better understand both the opportunities and challenges of generative modelling from a Human-AI interaction perspective for the creation of both physical and digital artifacts.
